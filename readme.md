The purpose of this project is to improve the real-time performance of ROS systems. Includes two ROS nodes and three orocos component. The ROS node is used to drive the urg laser to obtain the laser data and filter it. The three orocos of the component is used to determine the distance of the laser measurement. When the obstacle distance is less than a certain value, the serial port sends out the fixed string signal outward. Measure the time from the detected obstacle to the output of the signal from the serial port T1. We want T1 to be as small as possible.
